          The Forecast API allows you to look up the weather anywhere on
          the globe, returning (where available):

          * Current conditions
          * Minute-by-minute forecasts out to 1 hour
          * Hour-by-hour forecasts out to 48 hours
          * Day-by-day forecasts out to 7 days

              miles per hour, and `nearestStormDistance` and `visibility`
              are in miles, as in the US.
            * `auto` selects the relevant units automatically, based

    # TODO: The Forecast Data API supports HTTP compression.
    #   We heartily recommend using it, as it will make responses much
    #   smaller over the wire. To enable it, simply add an
    #   Accept-Encoding: gzip header to your request.
